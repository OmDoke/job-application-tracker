## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (if using Java backend)
  * **npm** 
  * **Git**


### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sagarghodke1204/JOB-APPLICATION-TRACKER.git
    cd JOB-APPLICATION-TRACKER
    ```
2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend # Or the path to your frontend directory
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend # Or the path to your backend directory
    # Depending on your backend technology:
    # For Node.js: npm install # or yarn install
    # For Python: pip install -r requirements.txt
    # For Java (Maven/Gradle): No explicit install, handled by build tools
    ```
4.  **Database Setup:**
      * **(If using a database like MySQL/PostgreSQL):** Create a database and configure the connection string in your backend's environment variables or configuration file.
        ```
        # Example for .env file
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_USER=your_username
        DB_PASSWORD=your_password
        DB_NAME=job_tracker_db
        ```
      * **(If using a local database like SQLite):** The database file might be created automatically on first run, or require a specific command.
      * **(If using MongoDB):** Ensure MongoDB is running or configure connection to a cloud instance.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    ```bash
    # for SpringBoot: mvn install clean
    # For Java: mvn spring-boot:run 
    ```

    The backend will typically run on `http://localhost:8888` 

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend 
    npm start  
    ```

    The frontend will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running:

1.  **Register/Login:** Create a new user account or log in if you already have one.
2.  **Add Applications:** Use the "Add New Application" feature to input details for each job you apply to.
3.  **Update Status:** Change the status of your applications as you progress through the hiring process.

4.  **View Dashboard:** Monitor your overall job search progress and quickly see pending actions.
