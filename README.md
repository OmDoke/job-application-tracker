## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Node.js** (if using JavaScript/Node.js backend) OR **Python** (if using Python backend) OR **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (if using Java backend)
  * **npm** or **yarn** (for frontend dependencies)
  * **Git**
  * *(Specify any database server or other specific tools needed, e.g., Docker if containerized)*

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sagarghodke1204/JOB-APPLICATION-TRACKER.git
    cd JOB-APPLICATION-TRACKER
    ```
2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend # Or the path to your frontend directory
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend # Or the path to your backend directory
    # Depending on your backend technology:
    # For Node.js: npm install # or yarn install
    # For Python: pip install -r requirements.txt
    # For Java (Maven/Gradle): No explicit install, handled by build tools
    ```
4.  **Database Setup:**
      * **(If using a database like MySQL/PostgreSQL):** Create a database and configure the connection string in your backend's environment variables or configuration file.
        ```
        # Example for .env file
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_USER=your_username
        DB_PASSWORD=your_password
        DB_NAME=job_tracker_db
        ```
      * **(If using a local database like SQLite):** The database file might be created automatically on first run, or require a specific command.
      * **(If using MongoDB):** Ensure MongoDB is running or configure connection to a cloud instance.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    ```bash
    cd backend # Or the path to your backend directory
    # Depending on your backend technology:
    # For Node.js: npm start # or node server.js
    # For Python: python app.py # or flask run / django runserver
    # For Java: mvn spring-boot:run # or ./gradlew bootRun
    ```

    The backend will typically run on `http://localhost:XXXX` (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` or `http://localhost:8080`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend # Or the path to your frontend directory
    npm run dev # or npm start / yarn dev / yarn start
    ```

    The frontend will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:YYYY` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
